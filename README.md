# Overview

Rambo UI, a Next generation material UI solution, we offer 2kb individually packed components or frameworks which contain everything!

### Platform Frameworks

`<Comming Soon>`

### Manifesto

A Component...
- ...should be cross-libraries but the code should be written once.
- ...should have a minimum style but easy to extend it via CSS by any dev.
- ...should provide some optional themes to make it easy to use.
- ...should be independently accessible (import just what you need)
- ...should be accessible (FUTURE RELEASES).
- ...should be made for developers, but accessible to everyone from beginners to experts
- ...should be tree-shakable.
- ...should be compatible with StoryBook.
- ...should be inspired by other UI Libraries and don't reinvent the wheel.
- ...should be easy to create new variants (We use bit.dev to help here).

(Inspired by the [Papanasi Framework Manifesto](https://github.com/ckgrafico/papanasi#-manifesto))

## Getting started

### Individual Components 
Bit.dev allows us to publish individual components unpackaged as small as 2kb! So now you can choose to include just that which you need.

1. Find the component below which you want to include
2. `yarn add @resnovas/rambo-<component.name>` or `npm install @resnovas/rambo-<component.name>`
3. Use the component as specified in the `.mdx` file or readme for the framework

### Full Framework in chosen language - Builder IO, React, Angular, Svelte, Vue, swift, liquid or plain HTML


2. `yarn add @resnovas/rambo-<chosen.language>` or `npm install @resnovas/rambo-<chosen.language>`
3. Use the component as specified in the `.mdx` file or readme for the framework

### Components

## Contributing

We utilise bit.dev to develop Rambo UI, we understand that contributing with this is complex to begin with which is why we have configured scaffholding and generators to assist in the process by simplifying as much as possible. This however does rely on using the bit cli. For those who have never seen or used the bit cli, we automate the build and publish processes, you don't have to use bit for every update. Things like spelling and grammar corrections, minor code changes or code styling can be committed directly to our github without using the bit cli.

** Any commit which alters the functionality, operation or interface must use bit cli **

### To get started within the Rambo UI workspace:

1. Install [bit and Bit Version Manager](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/installing-bit/installing-bit)
2. Clone our repository
3. run `bit init`
4. run `bit install`
5. run `bit start`

### To get started within your project workspace:

We believe collaberation shouldn't be restricted. You are free to work on our components wherever you like, or even copy our components into your own project and modify them to better work for you. Thankfully Bit cli provides this functionality for you.
